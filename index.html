                <h2>Toxic Work Environments</h2>
                <p>When work environments are described as toxic, there is no set definition or standard that can be
                    referred to in order to identify the issue. In general, toxic can be any situation or conduct that
                    has an adverse effect on an organization. Employees who experience toxic work environments have a
                    negative psychological response that can lower their productivity as well as their life outside of
                    work. Not only should the circumstances of the event causing these perceptions be addressed, but the
                    employee themselves must also be emotionally cared for. Collaborative workplace yields a sense of
                    happiness, joy, harmony, kindness, politeness, cooperation, facilitation at the workplace. Toxic
                    workplace cause anxiety, stress, depression, health problems, absenteeism, job burnout,
                    counterproductive work behavior, degrade productivity.</p>

                <h2>Contributing Factors</h2>
                <p>Employees can experience toxic work environments in many ways. Bullying is any form of social
                    interaction meant to cause harm. In the workplace, this can be in the form of unconstructive
                    criticism, ostracization, inordinate monitoring and humiliation. These harmful social interactions
                    can come from other employees or from management. While we do have laws protecting employees against
                    specific types of harassment (sexual, race, gender, age, etc.), bully that involves exclusion,
                    unfair work delegation or covert action can be less concrete and can lead to employees feeling
                    helpless or trapped in their situation. If the situation fits into the category of harassment, there
                    are laws and mechanisms in place to help the employee address the situation. However, taking action
                    against the organization or individual in this situation does not necessarily mean there will be an
                    improvement in their workplace environment. The ongoing misconduct and incivility of employees
                    starts from the top down. If a toxic workplace environment is to be improved, the whole organization
                    must take actions to eliminate or address what is causing the toxic behavior to exist.</p>

                <h2>Burnout</h2>
                <p>
                    Burnout is a resulting disorder generated from workplace and personal circumstances that causes
                    employees to be emotionally disengaged in their work. Burnout can occur from the continued
                    ostracization, bullying or harassment endured by an employee. It can also be the result of
                    dissatisfaction with the recognition of their work that can leave employees feeling like they are
                    invisible to management and the company or leave them feeling like they have stagnated in their
                    career. Burnout affects the organizations productivity as well as affected employee’s mental health.
                    It can also lead to more toxic conditions. Employees experiencing burnout can exhibit the same
                    incivility, mood, and aggressive behavior as those causing these symptoms on them. This leads to
                    passive or active retaliations in the workplace and further degrades the work environment.

                <h2>Effects on Employees</h2>
                <p>
                    Employees feel emotional and psychological effects from toxic work environments. Employees endure
                    their toxic environments because the workplace is a source of survival. Employees need to work to
                    provide for themselves or their family. Employees often evaluate their own self-worth based on the
                    way they are treated by management. If the toxic situation being endured comes from positions of
                    higher authority, the employee may be left feeling powerless and trapped in their situation. Being
                    in a toxic work environment damages their ability to communicate effectively, collaborate with
                    coworkers and focus on their work. This leads to increased levels of stress and anxiety that the
                    employee experiences at work and carries home. After working hours, the employee can exhibit
                    posttraumatic and mood disorders that can lead to substance abuse.

                <h2>Addressing the Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    Events and behaviors that contribute to toxic work environments lead to lost productivity in the
                    organization, higher turnover and psychological stress. It is important to not only address the
                    situation itself, but to support the individuals who are experiencing the toxicity. Employees may
                    initially voice their concerns as being a “toxic work environment,” but the organization needs to
                    identify the specific triggering event in order to be able to address the problem. The organization
                    and management then need to evaluate if the issue is related to their general workplace culture. If
                    the culture of the workplace perpetuates toxicity, punishing those involved in the triggering event
                    may only serve to endanger the affected employee’s ability to continue working. Retaliation, further
                    bullying or further isolation may occur between the employee and the workplace. If the employee is
                    left to defend themselves in this environment, it will only serve to cause more anxiety and stress
                    which could lead to higher turnover rates. Isolating the affected employee from the rest of the
                    workplace should be avoided. Isolation only leads to further detachment from the rest of the
                    workplace and does not work towards solving the underlying issues. The resolution should result in
                    the improvement of the entire workplace. The affected employee should feel that the organization is
                    working towards addressing the issue they are having, but if the employee decides they are not able
                    to reconcile their issues with the workplace they should be fully supported in exiting and assisted
                    with finding new work. Implementing educational programs about harassment and bullying can help
                    alleviate elevated levels of these behaviors.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Toxic work environments reduce productivity in the workplace and is an emotional and psychological
                    drain on affected employees. Organizations need to address situations of toxic work environments
                    from the top down. If toxic behaviors are allowed to perpetuate, they will lead to reduced quality
                    of life for employees and high turnover rates. The affected employees themselves should be treated
                    and evaluated, not just the toxic situation itself. Organizations benefit greatly by creating work
                    environments that make employees feel like part of a family, supports them should any conflicts
                    occur and helps them grow and advance their careers.

                <h2>Enhancing Work Environment</h2>
                <p>
                    Joseph Purayidathil and Salvacion Villavicencio conducted a study using Organizational Development
                    Intervention to enhance work environment and working relationships in the workplace. They found that
                    employees are more likely to enjoy their jobs if they feel like they fit in and are given meaningful
                    tasks. By having work that is not stimulating, employees will think of their jobs as unpleasant and
                    boring. This leads to a lack of satisfaction in the job and more likelihood of increased employee
                    turnover. Employees want to be able to feel appreciated and have the ability to grow in their career
                    in a work environment that feels like a family. Tension and pressure cause for uncomfortable
                    relationships between coworkers. Companies should nurture work environment that encourage open
                    communication that is constructive and is backed up by a strong leadership group that employees can
                    lean on if any problems arise. Organizing activities outside of work will help grow a sense of
                    togetherness in the workplace. Employees spend eight hours a day at work so it is important that
                    they feel that their coworkers are like a second family they can open up to and rely on for
                    collaboration. Empowering employees to express their ideas to the company and offering training on
                    teamwork, communication and other occupational skills gives employees confidence that they work for
                    an employer that cares about them.

                <h2>Toxic Work Environments</h2>
                <p>When work environments are described as toxic, there is no set definition or standard that can be
                    referred to in order to identify the issue. In general, toxic can be any situation or conduct that
                    has an adverse effect on an organization. Employees who experience toxic work environments have a
                    negative psychological response that can lower their productivity as well as their life outside of
                    work. Not only should the circumstances of the event causing these perceptions be addressed, but the
                    employee themselves must also be emotionally cared for. Collaborative workplace yields a sense of
                    happiness, joy, harmony, kindness, politeness, cooperation, facilitation at the workplace. Toxic
                    workplace cause anxiety, stress, depression, health problems, absenteeism, job burnout,
                    counterproductive work behavior, degrade productivity.</p>

                <h2>Contributing Factors</h2>
                <p>Employees can experience toxic work environments in many ways. Bullying is any form of social
                    interaction meant to cause harm. In the workplace, this can be in the form of unconstructive
                    criticism, ostracization, inordinate monitoring and humiliation. These harmful social interactions
                    can come from other employees or from management. While we do have laws protecting employees against
                    specific types of harassment (sexual, race, gender, age, etc.), bully that involves exclusion,
                    unfair work delegation or covert action can be less concrete and can lead to employees feeling
                    helpless or trapped in their situation. If the situation fits into the category of harassment, there
                    are laws and mechanisms in place to help the employee address the situation. However, taking action
                    against the organization or individual in this situation does not necessarily mean there will be an
                    improvement in their workplace environment. The ongoing misconduct and incivility of employees
                    starts from the top down. If a toxic workplace environment is to be improved, the whole organization
                    must take actions to eliminate or address what is causing the toxic behavior to exist.</p>

                <h2>Burnout</h2>
                <p>
                    Burnout is a resulting disorder generated from workplace and personal circumstances that causes
                    employees to be emotionally disengaged in their work. Burnout can occur from the continued
                    ostracization, bullying or harassment endured by an employee. It can also be the result of
                    dissatisfaction with the recognition of their work that can leave employees feeling like they are
                    invisible to management and the company or leave them feeling like they have stagnated in their
                    career. Burnout affects the organizations productivity as well as affected employee’s mental health.
                    It can also lead to more toxic conditions. Employees experiencing burnout can exhibit the same
                    incivility, mood, and aggressive behavior as those causing these symptoms on them. This leads to
                    passive or active retaliations in the workplace and further degrades the work environment.

                <h2>Effects on Employees</h2>
                <p>
                   Employees feel emotional and psychological effects from toxic work environments. Employees endure
                   their toxic environments because the workplace is a source of survival. Employees need to work to
                   provide for themselves or their family. Employees often evaluate their own self-worth based on the
                   way they are treated by management. If the toxic situation being endured comes from positions of
                   higher authority, they employee may be left feeling powerless and trapped in their situation. Being
                   in a toxic work environment damages their ability to communicate effectively, collaborate with
                   coworkers and focus on their work. This leads to increased levels of stress and anxiety that the
                   employee experiences at work and carries home. After working hours, the employee can exhibit
                   posttraumatic and mood disorders that can lead to substance abuse.

                <h2>Addressing the Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    Events and behaviors that contribute to toxic work environments lead to lost productivity in the
                    organization, higher turnover and psychological stress. It is important to not only address the
                    situation itself, but to support the individuals who are experiencing the toxicity. Employees may
                    initially voice their concerns as being a “toxic work environment,” but the organization needs to
                    identify the specific triggering event in order to be able to address the problem. The organization
                    and management then need to evaluate if the issue is related to their general workplace culture. If
                    the culture of the workplace perpetuates toxicity, punishing those involved in the triggering event
                    may only serve to endanger the affected employee’s ability to continue working. Retaliation, further
                    bullying or further isolation may occur between the employee and the workplace. If the employee is
                    left to defend themselves in this environment, it will only serve to cause more anxiety and stress
                    which could lead to higher turnover rates. Isolating the affected employee from the rest of the
                    workplace should be avoided. Isolation only leads to further detachment from the rest of the
                    workplace and does not work towards solving the underlying issues. The resolution should result in
                    the improvement of the entire workplace. The affected employee should feel that the organization is
                    working towards addressing the issue they are having, but if the employee decides they are not able
                    to reconcile their issues with the workplace they should fully supported in exiting and assisted
                    with finding new work. Implementing educational programs about harassment and bullying can help
                    alleviate elevated levels of these behaviors.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Toxic work environments reduce productivity in the workplace and is an emotional and psychological
                    drain on affected employees. Organizations need to address situations of toxic work environments
                    from the top down. If toxic behaviors are allowed to perpetuate, they will lead to reduced quality
                    of life for employees and high turnover rates. The affected employees themselves should be treated
                    and evaluated, not just the toxic situation itself. Managing these toxic situations effectively will
                    lead to a better, more constructive work environment.
